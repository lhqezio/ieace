A manufacturing company was spending 40 hours per week manually processing invoices. Their AP team was drowning in PDFs.

## The Problem

- 500+ invoices per week
- Multiple formats (scanned PDFs, emails, faxes)
- Manual data entry into ERP
- 15% error rate
- 2 FTEs dedicated to invoice processing

## The Solution

We built a local pipeline:
- Tesseract OCR for text extraction
- Fine-tuned Llama 3 8B for field extraction
- Validation layer for confidence scoring
- Direct integration with their legacy ERP

Total cost: $2,800 (one used server + GPU)

## The Impact

- Processing time: 40 hours → 2 hours per week
- Error rate: 15% → 0.8%
- ROI: 6 weeks
- Freed up 1.5 FTEs for higher-value work

The AP manager said it best: "I didn't know this was possible."
