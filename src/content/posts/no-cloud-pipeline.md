The default assumption for enterprise AI is "cloud first." This is a mistake.

For 90% of inference workloads, the cloud is:
1. Too slow (network latency)
2. Too expensive (token markup)
3. A security nightmare (data egress)

We've helped clients move 70B parameter models to local hardware. The result? 10x lower latency and zero data leakage.

Stop renting intelligence. Own it.
